Import wait_random from the previous python file that youâ€™ve written and
write an async routine called wait_n that takes in 2 int arguments
(in this order): n and max_delay. You will spawn wait_random n times
with the specified max_delay.

wait_n should return the list of all the delays (float values).
The list of the delays should be in ascending order without using
sort() because of concurrency.
